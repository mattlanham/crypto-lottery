# Crypto Lottery

This project has been setup to learn more about web3 and solidity by creating a simple lottery concept, this allows people to purchase tickets and enter a weekly prize draw. There are some rules to follow which will be implemented via the smart contract, and this allows for testing of various validation.

The project can be run via:

```shell

// Start the front end node server
npm start

// Deploy the contract (locally with hardhat)
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js

// Deploy the contract (testnet Rinkeby)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby

```


Here are other useful hardhat commands:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
```
